# Health Data Analysis ‚Äì Power BI

## 1. Introduction
This project leverages Power BI to analyze health data across multiple regions from 2000‚Äì2024, with forecasts extending to 2026.  
It aims to provide actionable insights for policymakers, hospitals, and health organizations by exploring patient trends, hospital performance, disease prevalence, and healthcare expenditure patterns.  
The project highlights a 3.2% YoY rise in chronic illness cases and growing disparities in regional healthcare accessibility.

## 2. Problem Statement
Health data is vast, scattered, and complex, making it difficult to derive insights.  
Stakeholders like healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers need clear data-driven analysis to:  

- Track patient admission and discharge trends  
- Compare healthcare access and expenditure between regions  
- Forecast disease prevalence and demand for healthcare resources  

The project addresses growing pressure on hospitals, rising chronic illness cases, and uneven healthcare distribution.

## 3. Skills Demonstrated
- Data engineering with SQL Server (20M+ rows using stored procedures)  
- Data visualization & interactive dashboard design  
- Predictive modeling & forecasting  
- Data transformation using Power Query and DAX  
- Data modeling with a star schema  
- Insight storytelling & UX-focused reporting  

## 4. Data Sourcing
- **Source**: Self-created dataset using Microsoft SQL Server  
- **Process**:  
  - Designed and populated a health dataset of **20M+ rows**  
  - Automated data generation & population using **T-SQL stored procedures**
   
- **Scope**:  
  - Patient admission & discharge records  
  - Hospital capacity (beds, doctors, facilities)  
  - Disease prevalence by region  
  - Healthcare spending & insurance coverage  
- **Format**: SQL Server relational tables (exported to Power BI via Direct Query/Import)  

## 5. Data Transformation
- **SQL Server**:  
  - Data preprocessing, joins, aggregations, and stored procedures for large-scale data handling  
- **Power Query**: Cleaning, handling missing values, categorizing patient types (in-patient, out-patient, emergency)  
- **DAX Calculations**:  
  - YoY_Patient_Growth  
  - Avg_Hospital_Stay_Days  
  - Expenditure_Per_Patient  
  - Mortality_Rate_By_Disease  
  - Key Influencers for hospital performance  
- **Prediction Metrics**: Forecasted patient load & spending trends for 2025‚Äì2026  

## 6. Analysis & Visualization
- **Main Pages**:  
  - Health Overview ‚Äì Admissions, discharges, YoY patient growth  
  - Hospital Performance ‚Äì Bed utilization, staff ratio, readmission rates  
  - Disease Analysis ‚Äì Chronic vs. acute cases, mortality rates  
  - Expenditure Trends ‚Äì Cost per patient, insurance vs. out-of-pocket split  

- **Insights**:  
  - Chronic illness cases rising by 3.2% annually  
  - Urban hospitals show higher efficiency (bed utilization ~88%) vs. rural (~62%)  
  - Healthcare spending increasing disproportionately in urban regions

## 7. Business Problem Solved
### 7.1 Core Business Problem It Solves
- Optimize hospital resources  
- Improve healthcare accessibility  
- Forecast patient demand and budget requirements  

### 7.2 Key Challenges Addressed
- Rising chronic disease cases  
- Overloaded urban hospitals vs. underutilized rural hospitals  
- Uneven healthcare expenditure allocation  

## 8. Business Recommendations
### 8.1 Improve Regional Healthcare Balance
- Allocate more resources to rural hospitals  
- Incentivize doctors to work in underserved areas  

### 8.2 Optimize Hospital Operations
- Reduce readmission rates with preventive care programs  
- Monitor staff-to-patient ratios for efficiency  

### 8.3 Control Expenditure
- Implement telemedicine to cut urban overload costs  
- Subsidize chronic illness treatments to reduce patient burden  

### 8.4 Forecast & Plan
- Use predictive models to anticipate 2025‚Äì2026 patient surges  
- Develop early-intervention programs for chronic diseases  

## 9. Before vs After Impact
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| No clear visibility of patient growth | Forecasted 3.2% chronic illness growth for 2026 ‚Üí preventive action possible |
| Scattered hospital data | Unified dashboards showing bed, staff, and patient utilization |
| Inefficient budget allocation | Identified regional disparities, enabling 10‚Äì15% better resource allocation |
| Limited foresight | Predictive models forecast patient demand & costs |

## 10. Tools Used
- Microsoft SQL Server ‚Äì Dataset creation (20M rows), stored procedures, preprocessing  
- Power BI ‚Äì Data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, visualization  
- Excel / CSV ‚Äì For column definitions and supporting metadata  
- DAX ‚Äì Custom KPIs and measures
